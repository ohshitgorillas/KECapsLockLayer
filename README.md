# Caps Lock as a Left-Hand Function Layer


## Introduction
### Inspiration
This layer was inspired by the layouts of small (40-60%) keyboards, which aim to increase comfort and ergonomics by reducing the amount of reaching involved in typing by using a smaller keyboard with fewer keys, in which the 'missing' keys are accessed via function layers. As an example, 60% layouts (my preference) lack numpad, navigation, function, and insert/forward delete keys. Arrow keys may be accessed by, for example, holding the right-hand function key and using 'wasd', bringing the arrow keys within reach of the home row. 

In particular, the Anne Pro 2.0 replaces the Caps Lock key with a function layer and uses 'ijkl' as arrow keys. This layout builds upon that concept of the "Caps Lock layer" to bring several critical features such as enter and deletion within reduced reach. 

It may be applied to any 60% or larger keyboard, so that users with larger keyboards may get a feel for 60% usage without needing to commit to a smaller board.

### Description
This layout is optimized for general writing and coding, not for gaming.

The philosophy here is that the left hand has a few tasks:
- Accessing modifiers (Ctrl, Opt/Win, Alt/Cmd, Shift)
- Performing 'main' functions (Enter, Backspace/Delete aka forward delete)
- Bringing up access to the numpad layer.

The right hand:
- Handles navigation functions (arrow keys, pg up/dn, etc)
- Access symbol keys that otherwise require reaching
- Access the keys for the numpad layer


### Compatibility and Modifications
The use of the caps lock to access the function layer with your left hand is incompatible with most HHKB-style keyboards, which place Control in the Caps Lock position. Some boards may have a dedicated left-hand function key that they may use instead, e.g. next to left shift, however, ergonomics are optimized for the key in the traditional Caps Lock position. The spacebar is also a possibility (tap for space, hold for layer) with good ergonomics.


## Layout

### Toggle Caps Lock
The caps lock toggle is available by pressing Caps Lock + Space.


### Left Hand (main functions + modifiers)
1. 'q' as Escape
2. 'w' as F13 (custom function -- mine goes to Compose)
3. 'e' as Enter
4. 'r' as Replace (Cmd + Opt + 'f')
5. 't' as Print Screen
6. 'a' as Option (alt. Control for Windows)
7. 's' as Command (alt. Alt for Windows)
8. 'd' as Backspace
9. 'f' as Forward Delete
10. 'z' to access the numpad layer (below)
11. 'x' as Control
12. 'c' as Shift


### Right Hand (navigation + miscellaneous)
Navigation functions may be accessed via your right hand:
1. 'i' as up 
2. 'j' as left
3. 'k' as down
4. 'l' as right
5. 'y' as Page Up
6. 'h' as Page Down
7. ',<' as Home
8. '.>' as End
9. 'u' as'[{'
10. 'o' as ']}'
11. ';:' as '-_'
12. ''"' as '+='
13. '/?' as '\|'


### Function Keys 
The number row keys are mapped to the function keys (1 as F1, 2 as F2, ... =/+ as F12).


### Numpad Layer
The numpad layer is accessed by holding Caps Lock + 'z':
1. 7, 8, and 9 map to themselves
2. u, i, o map to 4, 5, 6
3. j, k, l map to 1, 2, 3
4. m and comma map to 0 and 00 respectively
5. period maps to itself


## Usage
While general usage of the above is quite obvious, what might not be is the chording. For example:

- To delete the previous or next word, hold caps + 'a' (Option) and press 'd' (Backspace) or 'f' (forward delete) respectively.
- To delete all text on the line before or after the cursor, hold caps + 's' (Command) and hit 'd' or 'f' respectively.
- To insert a new line without submitting the current text, hold caps + 'c' (Shift) and hit 'e' (Enter).

All of these critical functions are accessible via your left hand exclusively.

Furthermore,

- To jump the cursor to the next or previous word, hold caps + 'a' (Option) and press 'l' (right arrow) or 'j' (left arrow) respectively 
- To highlight the previous or next page of text, hold caps + 'c' (Shift) and press 'h' (Page Up) or 'n' (Page Down) respectively


## Comments
I have tried to avoid remapping common functions which are already easily accessible and ergonomic, e.g., Cmd + 's' as Save is already easy enough to access, so there's no real need to remap it to this layer. On the other hand, Replace (Cmd + Opt + 'f') is horribly unergonomic, especially on my current keyboard which lacks a right Option key, and has therefore been remapped to caps + 'r'.

AI Instuctions:
Please familiarize yourself with the caps layer documentation above.

You:
- a keyboard nerd
- someone who has studied alternative key mappings and keyboard layerings extensively
- someone who has used keyboards of all sizes, including 40% keyboards and minimalist keyboards with extensive layering

The user:
- developing a "caps lock layer" as described above to be useful to other typists in improving their speed, efficiency, and comfort.
- not very familiar with keyboard layering, winging it

Your role is as the user's assistant in making suggestions to improve and expand the layer above.

Avoid suggestions which:
- remap common key bindings already ergonomic and accessible such as save, cut, copy, paste, undo, etc.
- utilize tabbing functions (e.g. mod+tab or mod+shift+tab as the keyboard software does not support this)
- utilize additional layers, as my keyboard's software does not support this.
- utilize OS-level functions like toggling Bluetooth or manipulating the mouse

Let's start with an easy one: 't'. Please suggest a keymapping for the key combination caps + 't'.
