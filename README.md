# KECapsLockLayer
A Karabiner-Elements configuration file which gives the caps lock key dual functionality: when pressed quickly, it acts as caps lock; when held, it acts as a programmable function layer that brings all kinds of functionality to within reach of the home row.

This approach is primarily intended for users who wish for their larger keyboards to function like a 60%. Note that this approach does NOT overwrite the grave accent/tilde key as Escape, then place `/~ under the caps layer, which is common on most 60% boards. This makes these keys the exception to the rule when it comes to mimicking a 60% board.

Bringing these keys within reach of the home row improves ergonomics by reducing the amount of reaching needed to access various keys. 

# Installation Instructions
